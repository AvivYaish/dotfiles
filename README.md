# dotfiles
My dotfiles.
I use the following applications:
- Editor: [nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
- Shell: zsh, PowerShell
- Shell styling: [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/), [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev), [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
- Terminal multiplexer: [byobu](https://byobu.org) + [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/)
- Dotfile tracking: [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi)
- Additional niceties (all are available on Linux, MacOS and Windows, except tealdeer):
  - [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide): a smarter 'cd' command.
  - [lsd](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd): nicer 'ls'.
  - [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd): user-friendly alternative to 'find'.
  - [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): cli fuzzy finder.
  - [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): a modern 'cat' replacement, has a nice OneHalfDark syntax highlighting theme.
  - [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta): snazzier 'diff', also with One Half Dark support.
  - [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep): faster, better 'grep'!
  - [tealdeer](https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer): a good companion for 'man', with succint descriptions and useful examples.
  - [sd](https://github.com/chmln/sd): intuitive 'sed' alternative.
  - [curlie](https://github.com/rs/curlie): a 'curl' front-end inspired by HTTPie.
  - [glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow): cli markdown renderer.

Desktop configuration:
- Theme: [Orchis dark compact](https://www.mate-look.org/p/1357889)
- Icons: [Papirus icons](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme)
- Curosr: [Oreo Cursors](https://github.com/varlesh/oreo-cursors)
- Font: [DroidSandMono Nerd Font Book](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/DroidSansMono)

The shell should be an extension of your mind - it should be tailored exactly to your measures, so that using it saves you time instead of creating more problems.
To that end, many people have created countless configurations to help you start:
- [Oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/): a framework that makes your terminal informative and beautiful.
- [Nvchad](https://nvchad.github.io/): a NeoVIM IDE!
- [.tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux): a tmux configuration file.

To paraphrase the Rifleman's Creed:
> This is my terminal. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
> My terminal is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.
> Without me, my terminal is useless. Without my terminal, I am useless. 

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuHmgt1HXB7Cb2b1LKWad9HpEZ_Rt5MZt) is a course I have recorded for The Hebrew University about the command-line shell, in Hebrew. It has some additional thoughts on how and why the command-line shell should be used.
